XPipe 15 comes with many new features, performance improvements, and many bug fixes. Note that the installation data layout has been changed and executables have been moved around. This will break some shortcuts and the old restart functionality after an update. So if you're updating from within XPipe, it won't automatically restart for this update.

## Tailscale SSH support

You can now connect to devices in your tailnet via Tailscale SSH and your locally installed tailscale command-line client. This integration supports multiple accounts as well to switch between different tailnets.

## Docker improvements

This release introduces support for docker compose. Containers in compose projects are grouped together and can be managed all at the same time via the compose project entry.

The container state information shown was also improved, always showing the container state in combination with the system information.

## Other

- The SSH gateway implementation has been reworked so that you can now use local SSH keys and other identities for connections with gateways
- Various speed improvements for shell operations
- Add setting to disable HTTPs TLS verification for license activation API calls for cases where TLS traffic is decrypted in your organization

## Fixes

- Fixed application restart after update not applying current workspace directory
- Fix custom service commands not launching properly with PowerShell as the local shell
- Fix update check being influenced by the local GitHub rate limiting
