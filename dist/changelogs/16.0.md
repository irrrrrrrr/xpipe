XPipe 15 comes with many new features, performance improvements, and many bug fixes. Note that the installation data layout has been changed and executables have been moved around. This will break some shortcuts and the old restart functionality after an update. So if you're updating from within XPipe, it won't automatically restart for this update.

## Tailscale SSH support

You can now connect to devices in your tailnet via Tailscale SSH and your locally installed tailscale command-line client. This integration supports multiple accounts as well to switch between different tailnets.

## Custom icons

You can now add custom icons to use for your connections. This implementation replaces the old model of shipping the icons from https://github.com/selfhst/icons along XPipe. Instead, you can now dynamically add sources of icons. This can either be a local directory or a remote git repository that can be cloned and pulled by xpipe. XPipe will pick up any .svg files in there, rasterize them to cached .pngs, and display them in XPipe. As default icon sources, it will still come with https://github.com/selfhst/icons, but now it can fetch these icons at runtime. If you are using the git vault, you can also add icons to a synced directory in your git vault to have access to them on all systems.

Your existing custom icons set for connections are not lost, it just requires you to first update the icons and then restart XPipe.

## Package manager repositories

There is now an apt repository available at https://apt.xpipe.io and an rpm repository available at https://rpm.xpipe.io. You can add them as sources to apt or your rpm-based package manager. This allows you to also install and upgrade xpipe via your native package manager instead of using the built-in self-updater. 

## New docs

There is a new documentation site https://docs.xpipe.io. The goal is to expand this over time to provide proper documentation for many features. If you're looking for documentation for a certain feature, let me know.
